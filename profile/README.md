# The Research Integrity Project

Science is built on trust. When that trust is broken, whether through honest errors or intentional misconduct, it impacts everyone.

This project is an open-access initiative dedicated to safeguarding scientific integrity. We build and maintain open-source tools that help detect manipulation, uncover paper mills, and ensure that the scientific record remains reliable.


## What We Do

From our perspective, scientific integrity is a continuum process acting toward cases of bad science in three very important directions: Prevention, Detection, and Correction.

- **Prevention**: Should include educating people on publication standards and avoiding mistakes or inappropriate behaviors.

- **Detection**: Should implement robust, transparent, and benchmarked systems capable of identifying inappropriate content and behaviors within and across publications.

- **Correction**: Should discuss policies that facilitate paper retraction and correction as soon as any error or misconduct is reported.

This project focuses on the **Detection** part by applying digital forensics techniques to the scientific integrity context.

## Open Source and Licensing

We believe that tools meant to protect the truth should not be hidden behind closed doors.

All code in this organization is released under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).

We chose AGPL to ensure that this project remains free and open forever. If you use our code to build a service, you must share your improvements back with the community. 

## Projects

We are currently working on a dedicated system for image analysis, extending the [SILA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21535-3) system for modern and more robust forgery detection.


### 🏆 Open Challenge
We are also currently hosting a challenge on Kaggle to detect and segment copy-move forgeries in biomedical images.

## Join Us

We are building a community of developers, researchers, and forensic experts.

We are also compiling an Awesome Research Integrity page to serve as a curated entry point for anyone who wants to collaborate. This resource will include a roadmap of needed tools, datasets for training models, and guides on digital forensics for beginners.

Until then, feel free to browse our repositories, open issues, or submit a PR.  If you share our passion for keeping science honest, you are very welcome here 🤗
